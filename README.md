# Virtual Ai Pinting

Project Description:
The "Virtual AI Painter" is an innovative project aimed at leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create a virtual painting experience. This project harnesses the power of Python, OpenCV, TfLite, and Mediapipe to enable users to paint on a digital canvas using hand gestures.

Key Features:

Hand Gesture Recognition: Utilizing Mediapipe, the project accurately identifies and tracks hand gestures in real-time.

Canvas Creation and Interaction: OpenCV is employed to create a virtual canvas where users can draw and paint using recognized hand gestures.

Gesture-based Tools: Users can switch between different painting tools (e.g., brush, pencil, eraser) by making specific hand gestures, enhancing the interactive painting experience.

Real-time Painting Feedback: The system provides real-time feedback, allowing users to see their drawings and modifications instantly on the digital canvas.

Canvas Save and Export: Completed paintings can be saved as image files for later viewing and sharing.

Efficient Model Deployment: TensorFlow Lite (TfLite) is utilized to optimize and deploy the hand gesture recognition model, ensuring efficient performance on various devices.

User-friendly Interface: The project incorporates a user-friendly interface with clear instructions for gestures and tool usage, making the painting experience accessible to users of all levels of expertise.
